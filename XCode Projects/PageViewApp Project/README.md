# PageViewApp Project

The purpose of this project was to implement a PageViewController in XCode.
The example I used for my project was to create a page for viewing the specifications
and images of a weapon from Canada Ammo's website. I am no in no way associated with
Canada Ammo, a weapon from their website was merely used for demonstration purposes.

The information in the following example was populated programmatically, not hard coded.

The PageViewController implemented here is capable of:
* populate a PageViewController with a set of assigned images.
* allow the user to scroll through multiple images while staying on the same page
* extend the length of the page with populated data while allowing the user to scroll down the page.
