# Archer Game Project

This project was an optional assignment for additonal marks, the goal of this project was to
create an iOs game application where an archer fires arrows at falling beachballs when the
screen is tapped. 

The archer is fully animated along with particle effects and sound effects that appear when 
the balls are popped. A the end of the game the player is shown their score based on how
many balls were popped.
