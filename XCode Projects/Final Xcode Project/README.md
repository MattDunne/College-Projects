# Final XCode Project

This project was the final project I had to hand in by the end of the semester.

The purpose of this project was to create an application for a fake college by
the name of name of "College of the South Pacific". This project was created for
both iOs and Android as final projects, but both were completed for seperate courses
using completely different IDE's and programming languages.

With this application users would be able to:
* Have a main hub screen with icons to bring them to different sections of the application.
* naviagate a custommade calendar application that shows the current date and populates the calendar with customly created events.
* Open up Picker to select a specific Program with a specified year of study to acquire a class scheduled that is populated by xml data.
* Browse through course specifications including courses that will be taken, what year they're taken in said program, and how many credits they're worth. 
Again, this is populated by xml data.
* View a list that is capable of accesing the phone's built phone or email applications to call the school.
* See the school's location through the use of the Apple Maps application.
* create a webpageview to visit Metrobus' website to attain a bus schedule.
* Scroll through a news page that is populated with xml data.
