# Archer Game Project

This project was an optional assignment for additonal marks.

the goal of this project was to create an iOs game application in which: 
* There is a splash screen prompting user to begin the game.
* An archer sprite with multiple frames of animation is implemented.
* Arrows are fired from the archer character when the screen is tapped.
* beachballs fall from the sky and spawn a popping animation along with a sound 
effect when struck by arrow
