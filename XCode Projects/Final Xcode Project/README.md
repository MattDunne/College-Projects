# Final XCode Project

This project was the final project I had to hand in by the end of the semester.

The purpose of this project was to create an application for a fake college by
the name of name of 'College of the South Pacific". 

With this application users would be able to:
* Have a main hub screen with icons to bring them to different sections of the application.
* naviagate a custommade calendar application that shows the current date and populates the calendar with customly created events.
* Open up Picker to select a specific Program with a specified year of study to acquire a class scheduled that is populated by xml data.
* Browse through course specifications including courses that will be taken, what year they're taken in said program, and how many credits they're worth. 
Again, this is populated by xml data.
* View a list that is capable of accesing the phone's built phone or email applications to call the school.
* See the school's location through the use of the Apple Maps application.
* create a webpageview to visit Metrobus' website to attain a bus schedule.
* Scroll through a news page that is populated with xml data.
