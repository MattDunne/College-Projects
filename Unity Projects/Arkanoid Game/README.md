# Arkanoid Game

The purpose of this project was to create an Arkanoid game in the Unity 2D
game engine. The game is a short 2 level game and is merely a demonstration
of Unity knowledge.

What the player is capable of doing is:
* move paddle back forth through the use of the A and D keys or the LEFT and RIGHT arrow keys.
* the ball at the beginning of a round using the SPACE bar.
* bounce the ball using the player controlled paddle.

Some features of the game are:
* Particle effects that trail behind the ball to give it a feeling of velocity.
* Particle effects of blocks flying through the air when a block is destroyed.
* Score and life keeping in the top right corner.
* Restarts game automatically when the player runs out of lives.
* Advances player to next level automatically when all the blocks are destroyed.
