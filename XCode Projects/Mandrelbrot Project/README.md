# Mandrelbrot Project

This project was to complete a Mandrelbrot set using mathematical functions in the Objective C
programming language. 

The Mandelbrot set can be explained with the equation zn+1 = zn2 + c. In that equation, c and z 
are complex numbers and n is zero or a positive integer (natural number). Starting with z0=0, c 
is in the Mandelbrot set if the absolute value of zn never becomes larger than a certain number 
(that number depends on c), no matter how large n gets.
